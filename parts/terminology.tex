\section{Terminology}

\emph{For the purpose of presence tracing we are interested in crowds that gather at a certain location at a certain time. This could be a friday evening at a bar, or a Tuesday afternoon meeting in a community center, or even an exhibition fair spread out over several buildings. For readability, however, we use the term “location” to refer to locations at a specific time as well as specific events that happen within one or more locations.}
