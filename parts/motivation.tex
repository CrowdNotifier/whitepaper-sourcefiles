\section{Motivations}
\paragraph{Checks on power and population control}
Digital presence tracing systems facilitate the notification of individuals who meet epidemiologically-defined criteria (e.g., were present at a location within a certain time window compared to a potential index case). Existing presence tracing systems do so at the sole discretion of a central authority such as a public health agency. Such infrastructure can, however, be easily abused if a central authority utilises it for non-epidemiological purposes: With a registry of locations, and background knowledge (e.g., about the demographics or characteristics of visitors to those locations), segments of the population can be ordered to quarantine with no additional infrastructure or cost.

This contrasts with proximity tracing technologies such as Exposure Notification, where to trigger notifications with this effect would require the deployment of physical infrastructure (ie., Bluetooth emitters) which could not operate with the same certainty, costless scalability, or undetectability. When combined with legal obligations to quarantine and/or individuals' personal desire not to infect others, systems of presence tracing that operate at the discretion of a central authority could serve as a method of population control. It could, for example, be used as a tool for voter suppression, particularly as political actors often already hold detailed background knowledge as to the location and demographics of voters holding different electoral intentions. As a consequence, digital presence tracking systems should be designed to effectively meet genuine epidemiological goals while introducing safeguards against this potential abuse of power by central authorities.

\paragraph{Safeguards for privacy}
A second group of concerns around presence tracing relates to issues of individual privacy. Systems which leak individuals’ location histories can be abused in a variety of ways depending on to whom the leak occurs. Leaks to central authorities may result in persecution; leaks to other users, such as perpetrators of intimate partner violence and abuse, may exacerbate coercive control. Digital presence tracing systems should be designed to remove or minimise these risks.

Concerns for the confidentiality of locations	A third group of concerns relates to the confidentiality of locations, and societal harms that can result from rendering the existence of social gatherings, meetings and communities centrally legible and machine-readable. While many venues already volunteer or are legally compelled to be part of large and often publicly accessible databases (e.g., bars for licensing or mapping purposes), this is not the case for all epidemiologically relevant gatherings. For some, such as political or religious gatherings, a technology that demands they formally register their existence to an entity outside their community (such as a central authority) may itself pose a threat regardless of the individual privacy protections or safeguards on the power to issue notifications. While technological safeguards may help mitigate some concerns, at the heart of this issue is the definition (which may be in law) of what constitutes a relevant `location' for epidemiological purposes. Choosing to broaden this beyond existing, self-published locations (e.g., most restaurants, bars, cafés) will be a political choice that cannot be easily specified or limited by a technological protocol, and the breadth of the definition should be considered in the proportionality of introducing any presence tracing system.

Additionally, the system should aim to maintain confidentiality of which locations were visited by SARS-CoV-2-positive people to prevent stigmatization and shaming of owners/organisers and visitors.

\paragraph{Gracious dismantling}
A final concern relates to the sunset of the system. Because the system is introduced in a situation of emergency, it is important to ensure that, after this situation ends, the impact of the system is minimal. Ideally, control on the sunset should be on the users' side, without creating a dependency on authorities. Successful sunset of the system should not rely on authorities dismantling infrastructure (e.g., by stopping servers, or deleting databases).

Moreover, it is desirable that once the system is not necessary anymore, authorities dismantle all infrastructure supporting the system. In other words, none of the infrastructure created to support the system should prevail after system operation stops.
